        RESOLUTION TO BAN NON-LEGAL RESIDENT UTILIZATION OF PUBLIC BENEFITS

programs for breakfast, lunch and weekends; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That Wyoming will not provide public benefits to persons who do not have legal
standing to reside in the United States of America. Emergency services would be an exception
and continue to be provided.



          3. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County-Wyoming

                 Gold backs) AS OFFICIAL LEGAL TENDER IN WYOMING

WHEREAS, the fiat currency of the United States is consistently being devalued by inflation and
excessive printing of money by the Federal Government; and



                                                                                                  1

WHEREAS, we had four great years whereby President Trump served America with honor
bringing us America First as he promised during his campaign; and

WHEREAS, President Trump demonstrated America's strength and why America is the leader of
the world; and

WHEREAS, President Trump is being persecuted, sued, criminally prosecuted and threatened

President Trump and his millions of supporters calling us deplorable and worse; and

WHEREAS, Wyoming is the home of hundreds of thousands of President Trump supporters and
arguably the most patriotic state; and

                                                                                                    3

          RESOLUTION TO REFUND EXCESS TAX REVENUES TO WYOMING RESIDENTS

fund essential needs and additional wants; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Republican Party calls upon the Wyoming State Legislature to
reduce property tax, sales tax revenues, and licensing fees, commensurate to fund essential
needs; and, be it also

RESOLVED, That the legislature remit to Wyoming residents the $168 million in excess revenues
that have been collected thus far and any additional excess revenues through the end of the
next fiscal cycle.



             7. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
              RESOLUTION TO RETURN TO HAND COUNTING OF PAPER BALLOTS

WHEREAS, Article 6, Section 13 of the Wyoming Constitution states, “The legislature shall pass
laws to secure the purity of elections, and guard against abuses of the elective franchise.”; and

WHEREAS, W.S. (Wyoming Statute) 22-14-114 (a) prohibits hand counting to verify tabulator
results by stating that “For ballots designed to be counted by machine, each individual vote
shall be determined by the voting equipment and shall not be determined subjectively by
human tabulation…”; and

WHEREAS, neither the voting public nor County Clerk is privy to the computer code that
directs the tabulating systems. (W.S. 22-11-103 (d) (v).); and


                                                                                                    4
WHEREAS, W.S. 22-14-114 and W.S. 22-11-103 (d) (v) conflict with purity and full transparency
of elections that the voting public expects and demands. Election results from machine
tabulation cannot be verified as the law stands today. Half of the injunction, “trust but verify”,
is precluded. One cannot know if legal or illegal votes were counted or not counted; and

WHEREAS, paper ballots contain no personally identifiable information; and

WHEREAS, hand counting has a reliable history, is inexpensive, non-partisan, secure, accurate,
transparent, and is an efficient method for determining the will of the people in their elections;
and

WHEREAS, a large group of non-partisan/bi-partisan volunteers for hand counting have already
indicated, through their signatures on formal sign-up sheets, their willingness and desire to
spend time training and then to conduct hand counts on both evenings of the primary and
general elections under the County Clerk’s supervision and authority; and

WHEREAS, 22-10-102 states, “The Board of county commissioners may adopt for use in any
precinct in the county a type of voting machine meeting the standards specified in W.S 22-10-
101.” It follows, therefore, that county commissioners may choose to use no machines, and
that on this freedom to choose within our County, the Secretary of State has testified and
concurs; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, that our County Commissioners shall take corrective actions to ensure purity and
transparency of our elections as specified in the Wyoming Constitution and Wyoming Statutes.



             8. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
              RESOLUTION TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM, IN LAW, TO RECALL ANY
                          ELECTED OFFICIAL ON SPECIFIED GROUNDS

WHEREAS, "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new
Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as
to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness"; and

WHEREAS, WS. (Wyoming Statute) 15-4-110 only provides mechanisms to recall elected officials
in "cities and charter counties"; and




                                                                                                     5
WHEREAS, The state of Wyoming does not have provisions to recall other county, special
district, school board, state legislature members, US Congress members, or statewide
constitutional elected officers such as Governor, Treasurer, Secretary of State, et al.; and

WHEREAS, On September 22nd 2021, Speaker of the House Eric Barlow and President of the
Senate Dan Dockstader issued a public statement via a press release asserting that: "We will be
assisting the Republican Party in ensuring there are appropriate statutory means to remove
elected official ... "; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED That the legislature of the State of Wyoming shall extend WS. 15-4-110 or other
section in Title 15 of Wyoming Statutes to include the ability of Wyoming voters to recall any
elected officials including special district, school board, county, state, and US congressional and
senate elected officials; and be it further

RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Republican Party hereby calls on Governor Mark Gordon to
actively, enthusiastically, and whole heartedly support this legislative effort as well as
immediately sign it into law upon its successful passage by the Wyoming State Legislature.




           9. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
       RESOLUTION TO REPEAL ALL OF WYOMING STATUTE 15-10, HOUSING PROJECTS

WHEREAS, local government should not compete in the development, ownership, or allocation
of lands for housing. Period; and

WHEREAS, the Wyoming Legislature, Counties, nor Cities should be entities that develop
housing for Wyoming Citizens; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That W.S. 15-10 Housing Projects be repealed.



         10. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
   RESOLUTION TO RESTRICT OWNERSHIP AND/OR POSSESSION OF WYOMING PROPERTY
                          BY PROHIBITED FOREIGN PARTY (PFP)

WHEREAS, the State of Wyoming has over 28,000,000 operated acres of farmland (according to
the 2017 census) and many businesses that Prohibited Foreign Parties would desire to
purchase; and


                                                                                                      6
WHEREAS, at least 12 other states have passed laws restricting sales to, possession of farm land
and/or over 50% ownership in businesses by Prohibited Foreign Parties or their agents; now,
therefore, be it

RESOLVED, that the Wyoming Republican Party calls upon the Wyoming State Legislature to
prohibit sales of farmland to Prohibited Foreign Parties; and be it further

RESOLVED, That the legislature shall disallow over 51% ownership in businesses by Prohibited
Foreign Parties or their agents.




         11. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
RESOLUTION TO PERMANENTLY DEFUND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
                  PROPOSAL TO OFFER A NEW KIND OF INVESTMENT
                       KNOWN AS “NATURAL ASSET COMPANIES’

WHEREAS, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposal would let investors buy into
stock market companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for the purpose of
protecting nature – including public lands – and making money; and

WHEREAS, this new kind of investment known as “Natural Asset Companies,” or NACs “is a
corporation whose primary purpose is to actively manage, maintain, restore (as applicable) and
grow the value of natural assets and their production of ecosystem services”; and

WHEREAS, these corporations will be able to “hold the rights to the ecological performance of a
defined area and have the authority to manage areas for conservation, restoration, or
sustainable management”; and

WHEREAS, federal lands, including national parks and national forests, would all be fair game
for NACs, as would any private lands with a conservation easement. These public lands could
become off limits to mineral development and grazing if a party that bought an NAC connected
to it wants it; and

WHEREAS, NACs could prevent development on the land in perpetuity and allow corporations
to monetize the conservation of the land; and

WHEREAS, that these companies (quoting U.S. Representative Harriet Hageman) “as possibly
the biggest land grab in our country’s history” and could be extremely destructive to the West
“because that’s where most of these lands are located.” And, being, quoting Secretary of State
Chuck Gray, “a radical attempt to cripple Wyoming’s core industries”; now, therefore, be it
                                                                                                 7
RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Republican Party calls upon the Wyoming State Legislature to
defund the SEC’s ability in Wyoming to roll-out the proposed rule as a more aggressive
evolution of environmental, social and corporate (ESG) scores.



          12. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
   RESOLUTION TO PROHIBIT PERFORMING GENDER-AFFIRMING SURGERY OR PROVIDING
           HORMONE THERAPY/BLOCKERS TO MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18

WHEREAS, thousands of U.S. families have been weighing difficult choices amid soaring
numbers of children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. They have had to do so based on scant
evidence of long-term safety (e.g., bone density and infertility) and efficacy of gender-affirming
treatment for minors; and

WHEREAS, according to a 2022 article in Newsweek, there was an astronomical rise in gender
dysphoria especially among young women. As an example, the UK saw a 4,400% increase from
the prior decade, “particularly among impressionable young people” and asking, “increasing
due to social contagion?”; and

WHEREAS, there are laws that prohibit minors under the age of 18 from voting or drinking;
however, due to “gender dysphoria” many are advocating to provide “gender-affirming” surgery
and hormone therapy/blockers to these minors and frequently without advising their parents;
and

WHEREAS, many individuals who underwent “gender-affirming” surgery regret it later and are
called “detransitioners.” Permanently changing young people’s bodies (e.g. hysterectomies,
mastectomies, castrations, etc.) if they don’t fully understand the ramifications of their choices
can result in non-reversible procedures and life-long counseling to cope with regret; now,
therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Republican Party rejects performing gender-affirming surgery or
providing hormone therapy/blockers to minors under the age of 18; and be it further

RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Legislature shall prohibit gender affirming surgery or providing
hormone blockers to minors under the age of 18; and be it also

RESOLVED, That parents must be advised before any minor child seeks to follow through with
any gender-affirming treatment.



                                                                                                     8
          13. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
   RESOLUTION TO STRENGTHEN AND SUPPORT THE STATE OF WYOMING’S ANTI-ESG LAW

WHEREAS, the State of Wyoming has passed an Anti-ESG (Environmental, Social and
Governance) law to protect individuals from the ESG movement and influences that threatens
the vitality of the American economy; and,

WHEREAS, including the blocking of the use of ESG in all investment decisions at the state and
local level, ensuring that only financial factors are considered to maximize the return on
investment, protecting retirees and taxpayers alike. This may also include eliminating
consideration of ESG factors by state and local governments when issuing bonds or prohibiting
state fund managers from considering ESG factors when investing taxpayer money; and

WHEREAS, financial institutions and insurance industries have discriminated against customers
for their religious, political, social beliefs, such as owning a firearm, securing the border,
increasing our energy independence – also known as “de-banking”; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED that the Wyoming Republican Party supports and encourages strengthening the
current Wyoming State Anti-ESG legislation that prevents any financial institution and insurance
industries from considering so called “Social Credit Scores” in banking and lending practices
aimed to prevent citizens from obtaining financial services like loans, lines of credit, and bank
accounts; and be it also

RESOLVED, that the Wyoming State Anti-ESG legislation include stopping financial institutions
from discriminating against customers for their speech, religious, political, or social beliefs, such
as owning a firearm, securing the border, or increasing our energy independence – also known
as “de-banking.”; and ne it further

RESOLVED, that the Wyoming State Anti-ESG legislation include stopping Insurance Industry’s
from discriminating against customers privacy, distribution, price discrimination, coverage,
redlining – also know as “de-banking.”



            14. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
                 RESOLUTION FOR PROPERTY TAX RELIEF WITH NO OFFSETS

WHEREAS, excessive monetary inflation through the past years has led to artificially high
property valuations, which in turn has caused the rapid and drastic rise of property tax liabilities
levied on Sheridan County residents; and



                                                                                                    9
WHEREAS, higher taxes have led to serious hardships for homeowners and residents of
Sheridan County; and

WHEREAS, the State of Wyoming reported a surplus of $2 billion during the last budget cycle
and the Consensus Review Estimating Group (CREG) estimates surplus revenue of $860 million
for the current budget Cycle; and

WHEREAS, a number of proposed bills in this legislative session fail to provide ongoing
protections for property owners, or create offsets to lost revenue to the State by increasing
sales tax, or do not provide immediate relief to tax payers, or have built-in year-over-year
increases in valuations creating a compounding effect in tax liability; and

WHEREAS, SF0119 appears to be one of the better bills currently being considered in that it
provides relief starting in January 2024, in that it rolls valuations back to 2019 prices, in that it
utilizes median income changes in combination with property valuation changes and uses those
to determine property valuation changes, or caps the potential increase in valuation at 3% year
over year, whichever is less; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, Wyoming residents resoundingly demand tax relief measures be taken by legislators
that are immediate, substantial, and ongoing so this scenario of escalating tax liability will not
be revisited in the future.



          15. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
    RESOLUTION TO REPEAL CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE UNIVERSAL COMMERCIAL CODE

WHEREAS, according to the UCC, ownership of a person’s property is actually owned by another
entity. Under laws in all 50 states what you actually own is a “securities entitlement.” This is a
new form of “property ownership” that is more like a contract between you and your broker;
and

WHEREAS, if the financial system faces a systemic collapse - nearly every stock and bond that is
in electronic form will be taken as collateral by the largest ‘too big to fail’ financial institutions;
and

WHEREAS, as an example: when a brokerage company borrows money from their bank, the
assets of the borrower are pledged as collateral for the loan. But if the brokerage firm becomes
insolvent, say due to a systemic financial crisis, a secured lender has priority over all the
accounts of the brokerage firm, including the property owner’s shares of stock; now, therefore,
be it


                                                                                                     10
RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Republican Party endorses South Dakota’s HB 1199 which would
transfer personal property ownership back to the owner rather than the broker or state, and be
it further

RESOLVED That the Wyoming Republican Party requires the Wyoming State Legislature to
Repeal Certain Provisions of the Universal Commercial Code and transfer property ownership
back to the owner rather than the broker or state.



           16. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
    A RESOLUTION OF CITIZENS OF WYOMING, TO LIMIT AND CAREFULLY MONITOR EARLY
                             ABSENTEE and MAIL-IN BALLOTS

WHEREAS, Article 6, Section 13 of the Wyoming Constitution states, “The legislature shall pass
laws to secure the purity of elections, and guard against abuses of the elective franchise.”; and

WHEREAS, accordingly, Wyoming Statutes (W.S.) 22-2-101 (b) states “This election Code shall be
construed so that all legally qualified electors may register and vote, that those who are not
qualified shall not vote, and that fraud and corruption in elections shall be prevented.”; and

WHEREAS, a growing majority of Americans reasonably suspect the 2020 and several
subsequent elections were fraudulent, facilitated in large measure by an unprecedented
expansion of no-excuse-required absentee mail-in ballots, inducing in 2020 more persons voting
absentee than in-person. The chain of custody for these ballots was severely compromised; and

WHEREAS, results of the 2023 Heartland/Rasmussen survey suggest that one in-five mail ballots
cast in the 2020 presidential election were fraudulent, suggesting a high likelihood that, had
mail ballot/absentee ballots been responsibly limited, important elections would have been
called correctly; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That our elected representatives bolster our election purity, as specified in the
Wyoming Constitution and Wyoming Statutes, by:

       1. Directing and facilitating the principal method of voting to be overwhelmingly In-
          person voting ON Election Day;

       2. Having strict methodologies in place for ensuring that those requesting absentee
          ballots are documented, confirmed residents of each Wyoming County and be U.S.
          citizens;


                                                                                                11
       3. Requiring those requesting absentee ballots to have verified disability, which
          genuinely prevents election day access to the polling place, to be a verified Wyoming
          County resident who has travel plans preventing in-person voting on election day, or
          to be a Wyoming resident who is serving away in civil or military employ.

       4. Mandating that acceptance of absentee ballots shall close no later than the close of
          business on the Friday before Election Day.

       5. Establishing guardrail protections for early absentee mail ballots to require signature
          witness verification by notary.

       6. Outlawing ballot drop boxes and ballot harvesting.

       7. Promulgating significant, severe penalties for illegal voting.




            17. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
            RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF TERM LIMITS FOR ALL STATE AND LOCAL
                               GOVERNMENT ELECTED OFFICES

WHEREAS, the Governor of Wyoming is term limited, demonstrating the feasibility and efficacy
of term limits in enhancing Wyoming’s governance; and

WHEREAS, the principles of democracy emphasize fair representation, accountability, and the
opportunity for all citizens to participate in the governance of their state, county and
municipalities promoting a robust and dynamic political ecosystem, where individuals from
diverse backgrounds and experiences are encouraged to step forward to participate and
contribute their time, talents and treasure to public service; and

WHEREAS, term limits encourage civic engagement and involvement by creating more
opportunities for new candidates to run for public office and for citizens to actively participate
in Wyoming’s democratic processes while limiting the entrenched incumbency in state and local
elected offices from stagnation, complacency, and apathy in correcting or passing needed,
appropriate or timely legislation for Wyoming’s tax paying residents; and

WHEREAS, term limits promote healthy and needed turnover in elected offices every 8 or 12
years, fostering and developing professional skills and education of Wyoming residents to
publicly serve their fellow residents, state and communities; and



                                                                                                12
WHEREAS, term limits debilitate the consolidation of corruption, power and control among the
electees, exclusive individuals, families, or groups of people using their elected position, wealth
and influence to indefinitely control and manipulate state and local governments through
financial and business predominance, thereby safeguarding the State of Wyoming, Wyoming
communities and Wyoming residents against corruption, coercion, intimidation, nepotism, and
financial control over publicly elected officials; and

WHEREAS, term limits revolve and rejuvenate political leadership ensuring elected officials stay
connected to the needs and aspirations of their constituents by requiring career politicians to
rotate through different elected positions thus developing their governmental understanding
while limiting potential for positional corruption; now, therefore, be it

RESOLVED, that the Wyoming Republican Party hereby expresses its support and resolve to
impel the adoption of term limits at all levels of state and local governmental offices by
recognizing the benefits that term limits offer the Wyoming electorate and Wyoming residents;
and be it further

RESOLVED, our American Constitutional Republic in conjunction with term limits will increase
accountability of elected officials, transparency of government, enhance diverse representation,
and promote vibrant and inclusive political culture that we currently do not see in Wyoming
politics.



         18. Resolution from the Republican Party of Sheridan County, Wyoming
 RESOLUTION TO CHANGE THE APPOINTED WYOMING ATTORNEY GENERAL TO AN ELECTED
       POSITION THROUGH PROVISIONS IN THE WYOMING STATE CONSTITUTION
                              (Article 4, Sections 11 & 12)

WHEREAS, the Wyoming Attorney General plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law and
protecting the interests of the State of Wyoming and Wyoming Residents; and,

WHEREAS, the current statutory framework in Wyoming allows for the appointment of the
Attorney General by the Governor, undermining the independence and impartiality of the
position and the freedom of the Attorney General to act on the duties of the office without the
permission of the Governor; and

WHEREAS, the Attorney General should be independently elected as is done in most states in
our nation to ensure the sovereignty of the position, avoid compromises in the impartiality and
