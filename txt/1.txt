                        RESOLUTION TO BAN NON-CITIZEN VOTING

WHEREAS, noncitizen voting is a significant problem in this nation in many states and is
facilitated and or made legal in many states; and

WHEREAS, illegal aliens, immigrants, and non-citizens are coming into America in an
uncontrolled, lawless manner in unconscionable numbers from all over the world; now,
therefore, be it

RESOLVED, That the Wyoming Republican Party does hereby support that only U.S. citizens who
prove state mandated identification, residency, and domicile requirements, shall be permitted
to vote in Wyoming state or federal elections.
